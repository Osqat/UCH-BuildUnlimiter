# 🧱 BuildUnlimiter (UCH Mod)

**BuildUnlimiter** is a tiny BepInEx mod for *Ultimate Chicken Horse* that removes the build piece score limit (a.k.a. “level fullness”). Now you can build chaos to your heart’s content.

## 🛠 Requirements

- [BepInEx 5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)
- The game **Ultimate Chicken Horse** (duh)

## How to Use

1. Install BepInEx into your UCH directory.
2. Place the built `BuildUnlimiterMod.dll` into: Ultimate Chicken Horse/BepInEx/plugins/BuildUnlimiter/
3. Go ingame and enter Freeplay mode.
4. Bang! You may now upload levels usually unuploadable.

## Building It Yourself

1. Install [.NET Framework Developer Pack 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
2. Download the source code
3. Run build.bat
4. Build will be available in the source code folder /plugins

## Credits to **[knus](https://github.com/KnusBernd)** for improvements to the code.
## Huge thanks to **[moep](https://github.com/batram)** for creating the original [DanceForce](https://github.com/batram/UCH-DanceForce/tree/main) mod — this project is based on their structure and helped me learn how to mod UCH in the first place.
